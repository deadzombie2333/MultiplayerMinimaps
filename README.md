# multiplayer-minimap
Change the original minimap so player can control both side of army

In this map friendly is still marines and hostile lings. F2 (select all army) only select friendly marine unit. One have to manully choose zerglings and banelings to control their move. Basically this still a single player game with control of both side.

I'll see if I can turn this into multiplayer game with seperate control.
