# update 01/12/18:

Update the race selection of minimap. Now, player can select which side they want to play, versus build-in AI or another human player. Also, these maps are now multiplayer map which mean you can play with your friend or practice versus AI. Default race for player 1 is terran.

I'm not sure if one can control his race use pysc2 command (give command to game before map initiated).

# multiplayer-minimap
Change the original minimap so player can control both side of army

In this map friendly is still marines and hostile lings. F2 (select all army) only select friendly marine unit. One have to manully choose zerglings and banelings to control their move. Basically this still a single player game with control of both side.

I'll see if I can turn this into multiplayer game with seperate control.
